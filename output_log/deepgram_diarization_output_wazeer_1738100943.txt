Elsa, do you have a lot of journaling things exist? Yeah. And, like, based on what I know from people, I think something's like, oh, I I didn't know about this. Like Yeah. How would they work?

Like, you can do this other time. Same thing, but, like, in podcast form. Right. Like, it'll read your memories, like, with different voices or with different Yeah. Like, for some talked about different giving different things and just collecting.

Yeah. So I think one thing, like, next step, like, tangible method to try to make this deadline is make kinda like a rough timeline if you were to pick. So first, like, you need to do the project. Yeah. Yeah.

Or, like, I was No.

Speaker 1:

1st is to write your statement.

Speaker 0:

Yeah. Because write your research statement. That's gonna

Speaker 1:

And then research question.

Speaker 0:

Thing is, like, I can write research oh, you mean, like, research statement?

Speaker 1:

The big abstract goal. Nobody, like nobody's even gonna, like, check it. That's it. I see. But it's just so you know that you're going along some direction that you care about.

Speaker 0:

Have this one doc that's just called research regime, and it's, like, my, like, statement.

Speaker 1:

Yeah. Especially, like, you said you might wanna do p h you said you you wanna do PhD. Right? Yeah. So then it's helpful to have this research statement.

Like, you have If it's just masters, then it's fine. You can just do whatever

Speaker 0:

you want. Like, it's literally just

Speaker 1:

like Holy shit.

Speaker 0:

You have this? Well, this is because, like, if I run a lab later, I wanna, like, explain one of the things. I feel I wanna go to a lab. Yeah. So it's like what types of areas, like, that you're specifically interested in, what type of contribution are you interested in?

Like, what are the keywords in your research? This will be really helpful for us if I can research statement. Yeah. I've actually done this before.

Speaker 1:

I've never done this before.

Speaker 0:

Just roll whatever. But, like, write your, like, one liner. Yeah. And then so, like, these are, like, to dos. Right?

It's, like, write your one liner. Mhmm. It can literally be one Google Doc with, like, one sentence in it. I'm done. Yeah.

Speaker 1:

I'm sure.

Speaker 0:

That's all I have for my research. So if you guys entire research, we can talk just memory.

Speaker 1:

Memory. Yeah.

Speaker 0:

And then the second thing is make a product timeline and kinda, like, allocate which parts you want us to help on. Right? I can send you a template for that, like, week by week, basically. Not, like, more detailed than that. Mhmm.

But what I usually do to to start this project is I literally will outline a paper. Mhmm. So I'm gonna outline, like, exactly I think I'm reading the, like, literature review right now, though. I'm kinda unsure what's there. Oh, okay.
